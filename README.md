Node.js: Professional README Generator

Why should I make it?
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project


When should I make it?
Definitely before you show a project to other people or make it public. You might want to get into the habit of making it the first file you create in a new project.

Where should I put it?
In the top level directory of the project. This is where someone who is new to your project will start out. Code hosting services such as GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab will also look for your README and display it along with the list of files and directories in your project.

How should I make it?
While READMEs can be written in any text file format, the most common one that is used nowadays is Markdown. It allows you to add some lightweight formatting. You can learn more about it at the CommonMark website, which also has a helpful reference guide and an interactive tutorial.

Some other formats that you might see are plain text, reStructuredText (common in Python projects), and Textile.

You can use any text editor. There are plugins for many editors (e.g. Atom, Emacs, Sublime Text, Vim, and Visual Studio Code) that allow you to preview Markdown while you are editing it.

You can also use a dedicated Markdown editor like Typora or an online one like StackEdit or Dillinger. You can even use the editable template below.
[How to create a Professional README](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide)
 I noted a link to your Google Drive video walkthru however I could not access it.. make sure and grab a public share link: https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2494822?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop#zippy=%2Cshare-with-a-group-of-specific-people%2Cshare-a-file-publicly I was able to run the app, enter in answers to the questions in the terminal, and was presented with a markdown file containing a TOC, and all relevant sections of a good Readme boilerplate! I did note a missing a badge pic for the License as well as a missing link to the users Github profile page. Try creating a license function to create the link before passing the data into your generator function. I love that you created a output folder at the same level so that you can output the sample Readme into it so that it doesn't overwrite your repo doc file. Really the the few reasons for a less than perfect grade were the lack of a clickable link for the github user id in the format of: GitHub Username: [tester](https://github.com/tester) Public access to the walk-thru video Readme is missing 2 or more requirements: screenshots, description, link to working walk-thru video Make sure and all all the requirements for the README documentation: including a title, description. a link out to your video or an embedded video in the .md file.  Something like markdown-creator or similar would be along the lines of what you will want.Here are some resources: https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716 https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
